Digital gardens are reminiscent of the personal websites of the 90s before social media changed the entire landscape. They are places where individuals publish information on their personal interests. According to the ethos of the Digital GardenÂ **dense links**Â are essential. Rather than browse a garden chronologically like you would a blog, you can enter into a garden anywhere and follow a different path each time you visit. In fact, their [[Labrynthine\|Labrynthine]] nature is one of things that really draw me to them.

Gardens are alsoÂ **continuously growing and evolving**Â along with the gardener. There tend to be three types of content in a garden based on [[Evergreen Notes\|Evergreen Notes]]. These classifications also indicate to your readers how complete the information theyâ€™re reading is.

## Classifications

-   ðŸŒ±Â **Seedling Scribbles**Â are rudimentary notes. They are ideas and concepts that Iâ€™m just starting to think about but havenâ€™t really started to take root yet. A traditional blogger would never publish a rudimentary note to their blog. Many of these notes will eventually be pruned or worked into other ideas. Some of them will continue to grow.
-   ðŸŒ¿Â **Growing Articles**Â are fully rooted and have begun to grow and mature. Iâ€™m making connections between ideas and know I want to take them further. Many will remain in this growth state as you realize you know all you wish to know about the topic. Youâ€™ve taken the idea as far as you wish to take it. Others will become evergreen.
-   ðŸŒ² **Evergreen Essays**Â are the culmination of your idea. Youâ€™ve researched, youâ€™ve summarized, youâ€™ve done a ton of critical thinking, youâ€™ve written your own ideas, you know enough to teach someone and you probably have to some degree. This usually culminates into anÂ **evergreen**Â essay, a course, or a book. These are the fruits of your labor and passion.

A traditional blogger would only publish evergreen essays and do everything else in private, before they hit the publish button. Gardeners follow theÂ [[Learn in Public\|Learn in Public]]Â ethos and do each step, from initial idea to eventual maturation, completely in public. This creates aÂ **collaborative process**Â where your readers can give their input on your idea and correct any mistakes you may have in your logic.

## The Dark Forest and The Cozy Web

-   The dark forest and the cozy web are terms coined byÂ [Venkatesh Rao](https://venkateshrao.com/).Â **The dark forest**Â refers to the public web. Social media and corporate sites where someone is always trying to sell us something and convince us that weâ€™re not good enough. Itâ€™s very difficult to feel safe enough to be our authentic selves here when we can never be sure weâ€™re even talking to a human but we can be sure theyâ€™re going to sell our data.Â **The cozy web**Â mainly consists of chat streams with strong gatekeeping technology such as Discord and Slack.

## More To Think About

- Streams are fleeting, rushing by us. +- 24 hours
- Gardens present info in a richly linked landscape that slowly grows and evolves over time
- Contextual knowing spaces > time-bound streams
- Notes linked through contextual associations
- Hypertext Navigational Issues are core
- Fall down rabbit holes

I first discovered digital gardening last year when I came across Maggie Appletonâ€™s fantastically comprehensive essay,Â [A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history).
