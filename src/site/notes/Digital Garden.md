Digital gardens are reminiscent of the personal websites of the 90s before social media changed the entire landscape. They are places where individuals publish information on their personal interests. According to the ethos of the Digital Garden **dense links** are essential. Rather than browse a garden chronologically like you would a blog, you can enter into a garden anywhere and follow a different path each time you visit. I'm actually really enjoying the [[Labrynthine\|Labrynthine]] nature.

Gardens are also **continuously growing and evolving** along with the gardener. There tend to be three types of content in a garden based on [[Evergreen Notes\|Evergreen Notes]]. These classifications also indicate to your readers how complete the information they’re reading is.

-   🌱 **Seedling Notes** are the beginning of ideas or a new interest that you know very little about at the moment. A traditional blogger would never publish a rudimentary note to their blog. Many of these notes will eventually be pruned or worked into other ideas. Some of them will grow into articles.
-   🌿 **Growing Articles** have begun to grow and mature. You’ve learned quite a bit more about the topic and definitely want to learn more. You’re not quite ready to teach the topic yet but you have at least an intermediate knowledge. Many trees will remain trees as you realize you know all you wish to know about the topic. You’ve taken the idea as far as you wish to take it. Other trees will eventually flower.
-   🌲 **Evergreen Essays** are the culmination of your idea. You’ve researched, you’ve summarized, you’ve done a ton of critical thinking, you’ve written your own ideas, you know enough to teach someone and you probably have to some degree. This usually culminates into an **evergreen** article, a course, or a book. These are the fruits of your labor and passion.

A traditional blogger would only publish flowers and do everything else in private, before they hit the publish button. Gardeners follow the [[Learn in Public\|Learn in Public]] ethos and do each step from initial idea to eventual flowering completely in public. This creates a **collaborative process** where your readers can give their input on your idea and correct any mistakes you may have in your logic.

-   The dark forest and the cozy web are terms coined by [Venkatesh Rao](https://venkateshrao.com/). **The dark forest** refers to the public web. Social media and corporate sites where someone is always trying to sell us something and convince us that we’re not good enough. It’s very difficult to feel safe enough to be our authentic selves here when we can never be sure we’re even talking to a human but we can be sure they’re going to sell our data. **The cozy web** mainly consists of chat streams with strong gatekeeping technology such as Discord and Slack.

I first discovered digital gardening last year when I came across Maggie Appleton’s fantastically comprehensive essay, [A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history).
