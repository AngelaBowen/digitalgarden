True knowledge requires action. Theory alone only takes you so far. You must apply the theory to your own life to see what works and what doesn't.

Knowledge = Theory + Experimentation
Knowledge Work = [[Published/Evergreen Notes\|Evergreen Notes]] + Action

### The System

1. Learn something.
2. Summarize it in your own words adding your own insights and ideas.
3. Write [[Published/Atomic Notes\|Atomic Notes]]
4. Attempt to teach what you've learned to expose knowledge gaps [^1]
5. Take action, try it out, see if it works for you. This cements it in your memory.
6. Revise notes as needed.
