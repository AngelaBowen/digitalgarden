Your purpose in life is your reason you wake up in the morning. It's the future you are working toward. The person you are working to become and will be. Without a purpose you are essentially drifting aimlessly through life. And even the things you feel passionate about feel a bit empty. The fire behind them just isn't there. Your purpose will add fuel to the fires of your passions making them a necessary part of your life.

### Questions

How do you want your daily life to look? 
What do you want to spend your days doing? 
What gives your life meaning?
What do you feel a passion for deep in your bones?

And the obvious, clichÃ© question:
If money was no object and you could do anything, what would you spend your days doing?

Craft exactly what you want your future to look like. What you want your entire life to look like. Write in present tense, as if it's already happened. This is how you will begin to manifest this future. It is an inevitable future that already exists.

When you know your life's purpose, you will begin to experience [[Published/Synchronicity\|Synchronicity]]. You will see ways the universe is guiding you. 

### Action

Make a list of three things you could do today to bring yourself closer to this life.Â You now have a daily course of action to start making your dream a reality. We become/are what we do every day. Get to work and make it happen!
