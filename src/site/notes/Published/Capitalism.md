Capitalism requires constant consumption. A yearly profit isn't enough, there has to be continuous growth year after year. How those profits are made is irrelevant, ethics have no place in capitalism. But even with the assistance of human right's abuses constant growth is not sustainable. It's actually the flawed belief that drives pyramid schemes.

I started a new passion project at the start of the year. I figured if I was going to attempt to sell a product online I should do some research. So I've spent the past few weeks reading marketing books, content creator guides, and social media techniques. 

The more I read, the less passion I feel about what I'm doing. The strive for growth kills the unique vision and innovation we should be seeing so much of online. And in writing this essay I'm once again feeling that excitement.

## I dream of...

- a less homogenized web
- more personal, individual, unique voices on the web
- more creativity and the sharing of creative processes.
- more [[Published/Digital Garden\|Digital Garden]]s
- more newsletters saying something new

I want more authenticity and less "you should be authentic while following all of these rules." I don't want to follow people who are following a script, so why am I taking advice from all of these people trying to sell me a script? 

Especially when I'm perfectly content to have [1000 true fans](https://www.ungatedcreative.com/p/building-a-more-beautiful-internet) and nothing more. I don't want to be the most famous, I just want to make a living being the best for the people I truly resonate with.
