## [[Published/Evergreen Notes\|Evergreen Notes]] should always be atomic.

- Each note should capture **one single concept**. Break it down until it cannot be broken down into smaller pieces. 

- Capture the concept **as concisely and completely as possible**. Find the balance between not leaving anything important out while not including anything that isn't needed. It's an artform you can improve at.

- Notes should be **densely linked** though associations as they come **organically**. Tags, folders, and other hierarchal structures don't work for making the kind of associations we're trying to make.

- No flowery or clever titles. **Simple and clear titles** make finding and linking easier.
