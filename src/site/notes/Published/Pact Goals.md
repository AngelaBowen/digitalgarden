Anne-Laure Le Cunff at Ness Labs developed the PACT method [making a PACT as an alternative to SMART goals](https://nesslabs.com/smart-goals-pact). They have become an essential part of [[Published/My Systems\|My Systems]]. 

I created a [PACT Goal Guided Journal PDF](https://hacktheplanner.gumroad.com/l/pact-goals) that you can download for free.

## PACT Goal Basics

**Pre-requisite** - Figure out your life's [[Published/Purpose\|Purpose]].
- What are you passionate about?
- What would you love to do every day for the next few decades?
- What do you have in you that you feel you need to offer the world?

**Purposeful** – Your PACT should move you closer to your life’s purpose.  

**Actionable** – Your PACT should consist of actions that you can perform today to move you closer to your life’s purpose.  

**Continuous** – Your PACT should should be sustainable, challenging, and flexible. Focus on simple, repeatable actions.  

**Trackable** – Your PACT should be able to be tracked by answering the question “Did you do it?” with yes or no.

**Evaluation** - Evaluate your PACT on a regular basis.  If you aren't seeing any progress you probably aren't doing enough for your PACT. If you are consistently not performing your daily activities, you're probably doing too much.
