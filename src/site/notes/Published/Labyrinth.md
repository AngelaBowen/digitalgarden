If the universe does guide us to what we need to explore, it is guiding me toward the labyrinth. 

The labyrinth is often believed to be the path to God. God can also be ourselves. 

The shape of the labyrinth resembles a brain, and walking the labyrinth is a metaphor for exploring ourselves and our own minds. The physical act of walking the labyrinth is a meditative activity that puts us in the right frame of mind to listen to our inner voice and discover new aspects of ourselves. 

The ways of thinking you must develop to create a [[Cultivate A Mind Garden\|mind garden]] is also very labyrinthine in nature. This method of making connections between ideas works in much the same way as the synapses in our brain, making it a much more natural way of thinking and writing than the linear way we're taught / used to.

The ever growing, shrinking, and changing "tunnels" under the house in House of Leaves is directly connected to the labyrinth within the text along with analysis of the minotaur, where the entire topic of the minotaur is literally stricken from the story with red strikethrough. I have to do more analysis on the reasons for this. (Fully annotating this book is on my list of epic projects to undertake)

The labyrinthine nature of these things more than intrigues me, I feel a deep connection and need to follow this path.

My mind is a maze. 
The labyrinth guides my soul
within and without.

The labyrinth in mythology involves Minos, Theseus, The Minotaur, and Ariadne. Minos, being a king, felt the need to hide his son away due to his deformity out of shame. And since the Minotaur only feeds on human flesh, he also used the labyrinth, the vast, maze-like expanse under the city where he hid the Minotaur away, to rid himself of his enemies.
