[Andy Matuschak](https://andymatuschak.org/) proposed the termÂ [Evergreen Notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C) meant to allow us to create our own personal knowledge bank of interconnected original thoughts rather than the random notes we never come back to.

Evergreen Notes are a major element of [[Published/Knowledge Work\|Knowledge Work]].
Evergreen notes should be [[Published/Atomic Notes\|Atomic Notes]]

## Note Review / Writing Practice

- Look through note cache and choose a concept (by interest or at random)
- Write out the essence of that concept, from memory, using your own words. This shows you were you're still lacking in your knowledge.
- Break the concept down into more specific ideas, each in its own note
- Search for relevant past notes that fit these ideas
	- Link Densely
	- Create speculative outlines while you write
- Revise the main concept note based on new connections made
- Delete notes you no longer need
- Update connected notes if needed
