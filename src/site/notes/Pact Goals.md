Anne-Laure Le Cunff at Ness Labs developed the PACT method [making a PACT as an alternative to SMART goals](https://nesslabs.com/smart-goals-pact)

PACT goals have become an essential part of [[Personal/My Systems\|My Systems]]. I created a[Free PACT Goal Template](https://hacktheplanner.com/make-a-pact-with-a-free-pact-goal-setting-digital-journal/) at Hack the Planner.

## PACT Goal Basics

**Purposeful** – Your PACT should move you closer to your life’s purpose.  
**Actionable** – Your PACT should consist of actions that you can perform today to move you closer to your life’s purpose.  
**Continuous** – Your PACT should should be sustainable, challenging, and flexible. Focus on simple, repeatable actions.  
**Trackable** – Your PACT should be able to be tracked by answering the question “Did you do it?” with yes or no.

## My Current PACT

I will do 2 hours of focused work every week day
