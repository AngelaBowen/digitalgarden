## Rules

Cultivate your reading list by using a read later app. If you read everything you want to read as soon as you come across it, you'll spend way too much time reading things you don't really care about. Often after waiting a few days you'll realize that some of the articles you saved no longer interest you like they did in the moment. This saves a lot of time and effort and helps you curate your notes as well.

Keep your notes to minimal locations. Most would say one location but I find that's not realistic. I have my Obsidian vault where all of my notes are stored and linked. But I also have my digital notebook where I take hand written notes when I'm away from my computer since it's always with me. Once a week I transfer the notes from my notebook into Obsidian so it doesn't get out of control.

Make notes on what speaks to you. You'll want to make notes on everything that interests you but this isn't sustainable. Your knowledge band would grow far too large. You have to learn to notice the difference between what really resonates with you and what you just find interesting. Remember that we're cultivating a beautiful [[Digital Garden\|mind garden]], not mindlessly collecting. Great gardeners don't plant every flower they find pretty in their garden. They chose those that they love and those that grow well together. Cultivate what truly speaks to you and sparks your passion.
