ThisÂ [[Digital Garden\|digital garden]]Â is my experiment onÂ [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/). Developing the ability to teach something well is the best way to learn it yourself. Once you start trying to put a topic into your own words, you will quickly begin to realize where you are lacking in your own knowledge and use that to fill in your gaps. If you repeat this process until you can clearly teach the topic, youâ€™ll eventually really know your shit.
