I'm [[Who Am I\|Angie Bowen]]. This is my [[Digital Garden\|Digital Garden]]. 

As a gen-xer I find myself missing the internet of the 90s, where everyone had an Angelfire or Geocities website. Their own little corner of the web that fit their individual personality and interests. Social media has its advantages, but it has also homogenized the web in a very disappointing way.

So when I discovered digital gardens last year I knew I had to create my own. Then, after I decided I wanted to get back into web development and learn to code, I found the [[Learn in Public\|Learn in Public]] movement and felt that the two projects would work perfectly together.

One of the cornerstones of a digital garden is that it's not organized by date but rather connections between ideas. That means you should follow the links from where you're reading here, and explore the site in an organic way. Get lost down a rabbit hole and have fun!
