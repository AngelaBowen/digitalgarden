If the universe does guide us to what we need to explore, it is guiding me toward the labyrinth. House of Leaves started it and now I've found [[Digital Garden\|Digital Garden]]s / note based knowledge management. 

The labyrinthine nature of these things more than intrigues me, I feel a deep connection and need to follow this path.
