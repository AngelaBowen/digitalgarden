If the universe does guide us to what we need to explore, it is guiding me toward the labyrinth. [[House of Leaves\|House of Leaves]] started it and now I've found [[Digital Garden\|Digital Garden]]s / [[zettelkasten\|zettelkasten]]. 

The labyrinthine nature of these things more than intrigues me, I feel a deep connection and need to follow this path.
