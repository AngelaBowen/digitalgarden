[Andy Matuschak](https://andymatuschak.org/) proposed the termÂ [Evergreen Notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C) meant to allow us to create our own personal knowledge bank of interconnected original thoughts rather than the random notes we never come back to.

Evergreen Notes are a major element of Knowledge Work.

## Private Notes

**Reading Cache**
Email/Newsletters/RSS in the morning
Save anything you want to read to a read later app

**Note Cache**
Every few days audit read later entries and delete anything that isn't still interesting
Read article(s) collect interesting thoughts and observations while reading, each as a single note
	Notes should capture a single concept, concisely, and in its entirety
	Densely linked through organic associations rather than hierarchies
	Concept oriented
	Clearly Titled

Spaced Repetition
Close open loops

## Public Notes

Evergreen Notes - Where [[Learn in Public\|Learn in Public]] begins

ðŸŒ² **Evergreen Essays** - Complete or Near-Complete essays

Always try to see the big picture and clusters of ideas

## Note Review / Writing Practice

- Look through note cache and decide on one / a cluster
- Write a broad note that captures the big idea (single concept) in your own words from memory
- Write finer grained notes capturing more nuanced ideas of the concept
- Search for relevant past notes that fit these ideas
	- Link Densely
	- Create speculative outlines while you write
- Revise the broad note based on the new details
- Remove notes that are no longer necessary
- Update other notes as needed
