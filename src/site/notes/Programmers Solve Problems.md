Programming is not about the code you write nor the language you write it in. Programming is about solving problems. Harvardâ€™s CS50 course breaks problem solving down to this most basic element of computer science.

> Problem solving is the process of taking some input (a problem that needs to be solved) and generating some output (the solution to the problem).

I saw this lesson cemented when I moved on to week 1 and started doing the exercises in C, a language Iâ€™ve never even looked at before. I found myself not worrying about the syntax or trying to remember terms. Instead I was focused on the particular language I was working with, C, and seeing how it can be used to solve problems.

Ultimately, when using a programming language, it comes down to figuring out how to solve a problem within the limitations of that specific language. This is why itâ€™s more important to be fluent inÂ [[programming logic\|programming logic]]Â than in any one particular language.
